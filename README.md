##Project Title
Exploration of Basic Machine Learning Models

##Overview
Taken a basic yet trending dataset from kaggle named as "Breast Cancer Wisconsin(Diagnostic) Dataset". Later explored the dataset and define mutliple Machine Learning Models and compared the models to find the best model suitable for my dataset.

##Usage:
After cloning or forking the repository to your local system, open and run the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Follow the instructions within each notebook to explore and analyze the models. The trained models can be reviewed in the `models` directory.


##Models Directory:
Contains serialized model files (.joblib or .pkl) saved after training various machine learning models on the dataset.

##Data Directory:
Contains "Breast Cancer Wisconsin(Diagnostic) Dataset" and used for training and evaluation.

##Notebook Directory:
Contains jupyter notebook files(.ipynb). I have stored MLmodels.ipynb file
